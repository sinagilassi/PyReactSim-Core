class X(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents the state of a component in a reaction, including the component itself and its order in the reaction.

    - For a reaction A + 2B -> C, the state of component A would have an order of 1, while the state of component B would have an order of 2.

    Attributes
    ----------
    component: Component
        Component object containing information about the component (e.g., name, formula, state).
    order: float | int
        The order of the reaction with respect to this component. This indicates how the rate depends on the concentration or partial pressure of this component.
    value: float | int
        The value of the state variable for this component (e.g., concentration in mol/L or partial pressure in atm).
    unit: str
        The unit of the state variable (e.g., 'mol/L' for concentration or 'atm' for pressure).
